# My Name is Vaidehi

normal text  
HERE IS NEW LINE I ADDED TWO SPACES ABOVE

## headings goes on getting smaller as u add # in it

TEXT is **BOLD** caus I added two * to it

another way to __BOLD__ is to use two _ before and after word 

*ITALICS* - add * before and after

both BOLD and ITALICS - ***VAIDEHI*** or __*VAIDEHI*__

text is ~~crossed off~~ - ~~
